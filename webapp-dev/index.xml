      <description>Add Binding Criteria when Linking to a Page The Link to Page ID column property allows the page Designer to set the page that opens when a user clicks a control, such as a button.
By default, when linking from one page to another, the DSP® links the pages using the key field(s).
However, if the key field(s) are different between linked pages, identity the key field(s) using Binding Field names.</description>

      <description>Add Columns to a Report for a Report Group Each report group must have one or more columns. The columns indicate where a group starts.
Report groups subdivide the columns within a view. It is therefore important that columns appear in the correct order within the view. All columns within a group must be placed to the right of the first report group column. All columns belonging to the Customer group must be placed to the right of CustomerID, but to the left of OrderID.</description>

      <description>Business Rules During the design of a WebApp, business rules can be incorporated into each page or for a specific field triggering an action or event. For example, business rules can be created on the Customers page to force a customer’s name to display in all upper case letters, or to default Date Shipped to be the same as Order Date. A page Designer can add a button with a business rule that, when clicked, runs the rule that adds one day to the Date Shipped date.</description>

      <description>Control Status Fields This feature has been deprecated due to the complexity it can add to views which are laden in control status fields, but in very simple cases, it can be utilized without bloating the data views. Control Status field is a field within the pages view (Horizontal, Vertical, Toolbar, etc.) which acts the same way as a Data Control View.
When used sparingly, it can result in pages that perform well and are still easy to understand.</description>

      <description> Control Status Manipulation Overhead Minimization Complex logic to determine whether to enable, disable, or hide page elements can often have the biggest negative impact on page performance. Since there are several different sets of control status manipulators, it can be difficult to pick the right one based on the context of the page.

      <description>Control Views Run Time Control Views (RTCV) provide a way to define column control at run time based on the data. This view type defines standard DSP® control statuses for columns on a page. These columns are based on data rather than a column property.
Control statuses are:
 0 – Disabled 1 – Enabled 2 – Hidden  In addition, select BOA™ Reserved Columns can be defined in a RTCV, for example, boaAdd, boaEdit and boaDelete.</description>

      <description>Create Dashboards and Charts BackOffice Associates® Solutions supports the ability to create charts and dashboards to display data. Individual charts of data are created by using the Chart page type. Dashboards are created using the Dashboard page type to create a collection of charts. For example, a dashboard can be configured to display tables as a bar chart and the package types used for downloads as a pie chart. A Combination Chart can be created to combine multiple chart types (pie, column, line, and dotted line) on a single chart page.</description>

      <description>Create Report Pages A Report page has a subset of the features available on a Dynamic page. Report pages are not editable. They do not have a Horizontal or Vertical View, only a report view. Like a Dynamic page, a Report page supports report groups for organizing a denormalized data set. Refer to Create Report Groups for more information.
In addition, by default a Report page can be rendered as a report when the user clicks the Report option from the Page Options (small gear) drop-down.</description>

      <description>Create Report Views The first step in creating a report is to create a report view in SQL Server. If a page has a report view, the report view is registered to the page instead of the Horizontal or Vertical View. Therefore, reports generated from Dynamic pages can display data for both the Horizontal and Vertical View.
NOTE: Report views are optional on Dynamic page reports. Refer to Enable Dynamic Page Reporting for more information.</description>

      <description>Create Views in SQL All Dynamic pages in DSP® are based on a view.
When creating page views:
 Do not include Order By statements. The Order By page property in DSP® must be used. Refer to Order By for more information. Name the column names in the table so that the contents of the column are self-explanatory. Do not alias column names in views solely for display purposes unless it is necessary to avoid duplicate column names in a view or to avoid adding labels and tabs.</description>

Service pages are commonly used for automating a process to execute business logic against a specific record set. This could range from executing public WebApp events (for instance, running CranPort packages) to trimming log tables in a custom application.
Since these pages are non-interactive, the user configured as the “Service” user (Configuration &amp;gt; Parameters &amp;gt; Service Options &amp;gt; Service User ID) must have permissions to this page.</description>

It’s also a good idea to apply the security definition to the page(s) that maintain the source of the data. This way, the “Update User Definition on Save” option can be enabled on those pages, ensuring that the user who creates the data will always have implicit access.</description>

      <description> Database Design All WebApps are based on a database which is registered as a data source in DSP®. Each page in the WebApp is based on a table and view in the database. Additional tables and views can be created and registered as list boxes, combo boxes, business rules, validation rules, workflows, control views and more.
This section contains these topics:

      <description>Decrypt Data On the Decrypt page, users can perform an ad hoc decryption of encrypted data. For instance, when reviewing data in SQL, a user may need to know the value of one of the encrypted columns. The user could paste the encrypted value into this page to view the decrypted value.
The Decrypt page can also be used to test the decryption process to ensure it is working and set up correctly.</description>

      <description>Effectively Implementing Security Definitions (Role Security) Security Definitions (commonly referred to as Role Security Configuration) is a feature that enables application developers to:
 Internally restrict data access to particular users (or roles) and Provide an external API to other applications to secure their data on the source of the data itself. This allows inter-dependent applications to share a single security model across the platform.  Refer to Set Security for a Custom WebApp for general information.</description>

      <description>Horizontal vs. Vertical Views Every dynamic page in DSP® must have either a Horizontal and/or a Vertical View.
The basic principle of page design is to keep the Horizontal View simple, and have more lengthy elaborate data on the Vertical View. Multi-row rendering of the data is responsive and less overwhelming to the user, while the slower computation / dense data displays on the Vertical View, which is loaded on demand.</description>

Even if disabled, on the loading of the page, the cell value must be looked up to display to the user. If several list boxes are located on the Horizontal View, page load time can be severely inflated.</description>

      <description>Naming Conventions and the Enforce Strict Naming Feature The DSP® is delivered with a BOA pre-defined naming convention for Stored Procedures and Horizontal, Vertical, Validation and Control Views, to name a few. The defined naming conventions can be set at the platform level on the Vertical View of the Parameters page on the Naming Conventions tab. These values are the default values for WebApps, but can be updated at the WebApp level on the Vertical View of the WebApps page.</description>

      <description>OnLoad Events OnLoad Events execute prior to the page displaying, allowing lazy data population. Use OnLoad Events only when necessary because executing a SQL Stored Procedure automatically increases page load time by at least 100 milliseconds, and page load time should never exceed a full second for a good user experience.
Refer to Create Events and Event Design Process for general information.
Event Complexity
An event that runs every single page load should perform very little work.</description>

Compromising Between Implicit Behavior and Excess Overhead
It is easy to overload computation and configuration logic onto an OnValidate event, because it requires the least amount of effort to ensure the logic runs as often as it needs to.</description>

      <description>Page Control View Business requirements may require edit and delete capabilities to be disabled, depending on the state of the page as a whole. Page Control Views (PCV) are created in SQL to determine if records can be added, edited and deleted based on the state of the page.
Once created in SQL, the view needs to be registered to the page in DSP® (Admin &amp;gt; WebApps &amp;gt; Pages &amp;gt; Vertical View &amp;gt; Control Views tab).</description>

      <guid>https://heathercloward.github.io/webapp-dev/page-design-guidelines/</guid>
      <description>Page Design Guidelines Follow these steps to design a fully implemented page with all available and relevant features to ensure a high-quality user experience for both business users and site administrators.
 When naming pages:  Use parentheses rather than hyphens to delineate the description of the page, e.g., Request (Role) rather than Request – Role. Pluralizing page names is acceptable.  If applicable, determine an Update and Insert method relevant to the page’s underlying data set.</description>

      <description>Page Design Overview After designing the database and creating the WebApp, register all pages and assign properties for the WebApp. Once the pages are registered, they are then linked to the Navigation pane, Configuration Menus, or accessed via another WebApp page.
Refer to Page Design Guidelines for general information.
To create pages for a WebApp:
 Register the page. Each page type requires a different process.
 Assign page properties, if creating a Dynamic page.</description>

      <guid>https://heathercloward.github.io/webapp-dev/partition_logic_semantically/</guid>
      <description>Partition Logic Semantically An application’s value is not measured in SQL object count. Centralizing logic can help consolidate an application into smaller, more manageable chunks.
For example, several “Customer” based pages select records from the Customer table. The table has an “Active” bit, and can be modified so that only “Active” customers show up on these pages. Many of these existing “webCustomer*Hor” views may already have complex WHERE clauses. Appending “[Active] = 1” to every WHERE clause adds complexity to the WHERE clause, and makes it less readable and cumbersome to maintain.</description>

      <guid>https://heathercloward.github.io/webapp-dev/precedence/</guid>
      <description>Precedence The simplest optimization that can be made to most pages is control view record reduction. UCVs and DCVs are usually the biggest offenders of unnecessarily large record sets.
The majority of the time a DCV is created, it selects the entire record set and does something like:
SELECT CASE WHEN [Field] = 1
THEN 0 &amp;ndash;Disabled
ELSE 1 &amp;ndash; Enabled
END as [Enabled]
FROM [Table] WHERE [Field]
However, DCV’s do not require every record to be present.</description>

      <description>Register the Database for a Custom WebApp The database must be registered as a data source in DSP® to create a WebApp. In most cases, the System Administrator registers the database.
The database contains the tables and views needed to design the WebApp. Additional views are automatically added from the DSP® after the data source is added and the WebApp is created and validated. These views pull in BOA views from the platform database.</description>

The Customization Review page shows each user that has access to the page and whether they are inheriting the customization applied to the page via the default shipped values, with an extension or via the role they are assigned to or via a specific user extension. The page could have multiple customizations applied and the User takes precedence over the Role, and the Role take precedence over the Default.</description>

      <description>SQL View/Function/Procedure Design Non-schema object design is the next most important thing above table design when creating a WebApp. When lightweight and efficient, even complex functions, views, and procedures can be implemented with little overhead.
NOTE: Avoid Global Operators. Any SQL procedures or functions that have to enumerate or parse full sets of table data are dangerous due to their inability to scale efficiently.

A default value can be set for these controls:
 Check Box
NOTE:The default value entered for a check box is dependent on the check box&amp;rsquo;s field format. If the field format is ‘Y’ or ‘N,’ select one of these for the default value. If the check box does not have a format, the column in SQL must be of type ‘bit’ and a 1 or 0 must be entered as the default value.</description>

Records containing fields that are Hard Required cannot be saved until the field is populated. Records with Soft Required fields can be saved but are not considered valid until the designated field is populated.
Applying the Soft Required column property automatically creates a view in SQL. DSP® then registers the view as a Validation Rule to the page and creates a default message that displays to the end user.</description>

      <description>Set Spanning Properties Spanning Properties is a method to reduce horizontal scrolling and present data efficiently. In some cases there may not be enough fields or differences to warrant creating a Vertical View. Use Spanning Properties to create a line break on the column headings to shift some fields down making the record two lines. For example, if the record has 10 columns, the Spanning Properties Line Break can be set on the 6th column.</description>

      <description>Set the Y-axis of a Chart with the Value Column Property Value column properties are used to specify which field within the web*Chart view corresponds to a Y-axis value. This column is expected to be a numeric type because charts can only display numeric ranges. Multiple Value columns are supported when there is only one Category column defined. When the graph renders, there will be n number of series. For example, if a web*Chart view renders [“1/1/1990”, 1, 2, 3], the first column would be defined as the Category column and the last three columns would be defined as Value columns.</description>

      <description>Table Naming Conventions Across the applications, a common naming convention is to name a table with the singular form of the underlying data. For instance, if the table is meant to store a data set representing customers, name the table “Customer.” Additionally, prefixes are commonly attached to the table name. “zt” represents application configuration data, whereas “tt” represents expected user data. Configuration data may include user data, but it’s still utilized by the application as configuration.</description>

      <description>Validation Rules Validation rules manage correct data entry. If the validation occurs upon save and fails, a message is displayed. Validation rules are based on views in SQL that are registered to the page in DSP.
During the design or modification of a WebApp, validations can be incorporated into a page or can be added to a field based on an event.
This section contains the following topics:
 Validation Rule Guidelines Register a Validation Rule to a Page Enable Inherit Validations  Validation Rule Guidelines  Use the naming convention webXXX_YYYYVal where XXX is the primary table or page and YYYY describes what the validation rule is validating, for example, webOrderDetail_QtyGreaterThanOnHandVal.</description>

      <description>View Dynamic Page Reports When the user clicks Report on the Page Options (small gear) drop-down, a report for the current page is generated.
NOTE: Support Report must be enabled for a page. Refer to the Enable Dynamic Page Reporting for more information.
If the page is in the horizontal state when the option is selected, the report uses the Horizontal View and fields available on the Horizontal View display on the report.</description>

      <description>View Report Pages WebApps can have a Reports option in the Navigation pane that displays all Report pages registered to the WebApp. In addition, a Dynamic page can link to a Report page. For example, the Customers page contains a link to the Order History Report page. In this example, the Order History Report link is a Dynamic-to-Report page link.
To view reports registered to a WebApp:
1. Select Report in the Navigation pane.</description>

      <title>View and Stored Procedure Naming Conventions</title>

      <guid>https://heathercloward.github.io/webapp-dev/view_and_stored_procedure_naming_conventions/</guid>
      <description>View and Stored Procedure Naming Conventions Naming conventions are essential as they make development easier, and a standardized set of naming conventions allows other application developers to understand behaviors and configuration.
Views have different sets of naming conventions. The default naming conventions display on the WebApps page’s Vertical View on the Naming Conventions tab. When naming views, follow these conventions.
By default, view names start with web* which allows a developer reviewing/debugging SQL to differentiate between table/view queries.</description>

      <description>View the Controls Available For A Page Type The controls that can be defined in column properties or a page are dependent on the page’s page type.
For example, a tab control is allowed on Dynamic pages, but not on a Chart page.
When a user designs a page with a page type of Chart, the *Page Column’*s page’s Vertical View displays only those fields relevant to the chart page’s allowable control types.</description>

      <description>WebApp Group Design When designing an application, the Designer should know the different types of users who will access the application. Some applications are only meant to have a single user who has full access to the features, pages, and functionality that will be put into the application. However, more elaborate and partitioned applications may expect different types of users to have access to certain pages.
Refer to Set Security for a Custom WebApp for general information.</description>

      <description>WebApp Layout Every WebApp contains pages and every page requires a page definition that represents the core function of the DSP® operation. Pages are based on views in a database. Each page can contain column properties, events and control views as well as additional features depending on the page type.</description>

      <title>When to use Value Columns Instead of a Secondary Column</title>

      <guid>https://heathercloward.github.io/webapp-dev/when_to_use_value_columns_instead_of_a_secondary_column/</guid>
      <description>When to use Value Columns Instead of a Secondary Column It may seem intuitive to always use a Secondary category when each record represents a separate value because Secondary categories give the best angle to manipulate data. However, Secondary categories do not allow for column properties that the Value columns support, such as coloring individual lines or bars.
An example of when to use multiple Value columns instead of a Secondary column would be for data within a finite number of possible states.</description>
