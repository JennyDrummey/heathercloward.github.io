      <guid>https://heathercloward.github.io/dspcompose/use_cases/add_role_dependencies/</guid>
      <description>Add Role Dependencies Roles within a template can be dependent on other roles, meaning one role cannot be finished until another is completed. Dependencies drive the workflow notification process by emailing the user assigned to the next dependent role.
Dependent roles run according to what is called upstream dependency, meaning if Role 2 is dependent on Role 1 and Role 3 is dependent on Role 2, Role 3 must be defined to be dependent on both Role 1 and Role 2, even though it is not directly dependent on Role 1.</description>

      <description>External Request Scenarios that Create Excel-Initiated Requests While an external request scenario can be configured to simply create a request when an email is received, templates may also be configured to accept an Excel file attached to the email. The Excel file provides data for the first Data Entry role in the workflow. In this case, not only will the request be created, but the worksheet data from the Excel file will be inserted into the table used by the first Data Entry role (after certain conditions are met).</description>

      <description>Finish the External Data Role Once the External Data role has emailed the spreadsheet to dspCompose™ and the data has passed the validations, the External Data role is finished, and the next role receives an email that the request is available.
If the request has no other data entry roles, the Data role is finished and the request moves to the Review role.
If a request has multiple Data roles, the next Data role in the workflow is ready for processing.</description>

      <description>Org Unit Security in Action Once the security view has been incorporated into request processing, Org Units can be used to restrict data on the Data Entry page and restrict which updates are performed in a mass change. Additionally, once the security view has been added to a Template Role validation rule (if the template uses validation rules), template role validation failures will be limited to records associated with the current user’s Org Unit values.</description>

      <description>Post Request Data to a Target ERP System Once all roles have been approved by the user assigned to the Review role, the request data is ready to be posted. As a recommendation, if a large number of records is to be posted, post request data during non-peak work hours, for example, after 5:00 p.m.
NOTE: When the Review role user clicks the Approve icon for the request, the user assigned to the Post role for the request receives an email if the SEND WORKFLOW check box is checked for that user on the User page.</description>

      <description>Use External Data Roles in Request Processing In addition to the Data, Review, and Post roles, dspCompose™ has a role type called External Data.
A user assigned to an External Data role receives a spreadsheet with columns for adding (or in the case of validation failures, updating) request data.  Using an External Data Role can streamline request data entry: the user does not have to log in to dspCompose™,  but instead works in a spreadsheet that contains only the required columns.</description>

      <description>Use External Request Scenarios An external request scenario tells dspCompose™ to create a request when an external data email account configured in dspCompose™ receives an email sent from a valid email account.
While an external request scenario can be configured to simply create a request when an email is received, templates may also be configured to use an external request scenario that creates an Excel-initiated request. In this case, dspCompose™ accepts an Excel file attached to the email.</description>

      <description>Use dspCompose™ with Integrate Looped Templates dspCompose™ is designed to automate the creation and posting of mass changes to a single looped Integrate template. Posting mass changes to SAP that require looping requires steps to be taken outside of the traditional dspCompose™ process flow. While the creation of dspCompose™ templates and requests to post looped Integrate templates is not a certified component of dspCompose™ and is not supported, the functionality can be incorporated using the following steps:</description>
