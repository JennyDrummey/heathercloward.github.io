      <description>Add Target Exports Transform does not load data into an ERP system; it stages data for export. Target exports are the last sets of rules to move the Target data to a location so that it can be staged for export to an ERP system using a loading tool, such as a direct load program or CTS.
This load program is set on the Target Exports page’s Horizontal View in the Load Type field.</description>

The notification can also be sent manually.
To configure notifications, at a high level:
 Configure Subject and Body of the Notification Assign a User as a Notification Recipient Send Workflow Notification for Report Readiness Manually  Configure Subject and Body of the Notification The standard workflow template can be updated to change the workflow notification email’s subject or body text.</description>

      <description>Correct Errors in Target Data Services Data with Fixed Remediation Rules Transform offers a quick and simple way to correct the data in one field for multiple records using a fixed remediation rule.
A fixed remediation rule can be used in situations where only one field in the Target data requires remediation to quickly correct the data in that one field for all the records. Fixed remediation rules can correct instances where a required field in the Target system has been left blank in the source data, or has been formatted incorrectly to be loaded into the Target system.</description>

      <description>Data Source Connection Types In Transform, Sources and exports are associated with a CranPort or SSIS package to either import or export data. These imports/exports can be from comma-separated text files, Excel files, Access databases, SQL Server databases or ODBC databases, such as DB2 and Oracle.
The CranPort or SSIS package contains two connections: Connection 1 and Connection 2. For imports, Connection 1 is the data source database or file and Connection 2 is the Transform object’s working SQL Server database.</description>

      <description>Edit the Priority and Publish Setting A Target is added and configured in Target Design, but a Target&amp;rsquo;s priority can be edited in Transform. The priority is the order the Target is processed. A user can also select the PUBLISH check box to allow all Target and Source reports in the Target to display for Business Users assigned to the reports.
To edit these settings in Transform:

      <description>Generate Documentation Transform allows users to generate and download audit reports for Targets, Target Sources, and objects. In addition, technical specifications and reconciliation reports can also be created and downloaded for Targets.
NOTE: The Generate Documentation check box must be checked on the Transform tab of Console&amp;rsquo;s Parameters page to use this feature.
The Audit report lists information about the object, Target, or Target Source, including the Source import and Source rules, Target rules, Target reports, and Target exports.</description>

      <description>Grant Users Access to Reports and Sensitive Data An Administrator must grant a user access to the Report Delivery pages.
Additionally, some reports may contain sensitive data. Access to view the data in a sensitive report must be granted by an Administrator.
If the user does not have access to the sensitive data, the record counts for the report still display.
Report Delivery pages are secured via report business user assignment at the report levels (Target, Target Data Services, and Source) in Transform.</description>

      <description>Import Sources A Source is a copy of the original data (system, flat file, database, etc.) from the legacy system that is being moved into Transform. Sources are imported into the Transform processing database, which brings data into a Transform object and saves time and resources from manually setting up Sources. The Sources that display in Transform depend on the context selected in the Context bar and the Target selected on the Targets page.</description>

      <description>Manage Target Sources A Target Source is a record of the relationship between a source table and a Target table. Rules and reports can be built against a Target Source to process specific source tables for specific Target tables. Multiple Sources can be registered to a single Target and processed individually.
Transform contains the Target Sources assigned to Targets in Target Design along with the source tables corresponding to these Target Sources.</description>

      <description>Manage Targets A Target is a copy of the ERP table definitions and contains the destination tables for the Source data.
Use Target Design to add a Target to an object in a context (a Wave and Process Area) and to assign a Source (or multiple Sources) to the Target. Refer to Create the Contexts for Migration Projects and Add a Target for more information.
Use Transform to register Target Sources, Target rules, Target remediation rules, and Target reports.</description>

      <description>Naming Conventions BackOffice follows a very strict naming convention that provides a methodology for creating names that each member of the team can understand.
Every table has two names: informal and formal. Use the informal table name, such as MARC or MARA when naming objects. Use the formal table name, such as ttMARC or ttMARA, when naming a Target rule.
Use the naming convention:
tr[InformalTableName]_[FieldName]_Sel, displayed as: trMARA_MAKTXUpdSel.
The formal table name for this table is ttMAKT.</description>

      <description>Publish Reports to Report Delivery Pages When a report is published it is visible on the Business user’s Report Delivery pages (accessed from My Reports in the Navigation pane).
Actionable reports are error reports with a non-zero record count. Report types for error reports are Error, Target Readiness and Business Readiness.
By default, reports are not published.
A user can publish all reports in an object, target, or target source, by checking the PUBLISH check box on the Objects, Targets, *Target Sources* pages.</description>

Remediation rules are used only when there is a need to temporarily fix a data issue so the affected records can be loaded into a test environment.
Once Transform has processed Target data, it generates error reports. Based on these reports, a user may create remediation rules to correct erroneous values so that the data can be loaded successfully into the Target system using a load tool.</description>

      <description>Report Delivery Filters Filters are used to restrict the data on a report so that only relevant information displays to the user. Multiple columns can be used to broaden the filter criteria.
The filter applies when the report is viewed in the DSP and does not apply when it is downloaded.
NOTE: Since columns not applicable to a given report are ignored, one filter can be configured to apply to many different reports.</description>

Report data access can be restricted for sensitive information or can be limited by report filters or target report segments.
This section provides information for two types of users. An Administrator configures Report Delivery. Business Users view the reports.</description>

      <description>SSIS Packages SSIS is the ETL (extraction, transformation and load) method for SQL 2012 and 2014. SSIS packages are created in Management Studio using a SQL Server Import and Export Wizard and requires licensing on both web and database servers. They can also be created in Visual Studio 2012 or 2014 Development Studio using Integration Services Project.
One of the functions of Management Studio is to handle the storage of import packages although it is not intended to be the design environment for SSIS.</description>

      <description>Target Report Segments An Administrator can identify a field on the report to use for creating report segments. For each unique value in that field, Transform creates a subdirectory and a report in the File Location indicated on the Vertical View of the Target Reports, Target Source Reports and Target Data Services Reports pages.
Business users must be assigned to a segment to view the segment reports.

      <description>Work with Objects An Object is a grouping of Targets and is used to organize business objects within the data conversion project.
Using Console, an object (or multiple objects) is assigned to a context (a combination of a Wave and Process Area). A Target and Source (or multiple Targets and Sources) are then defined for an object in Target Design. Refer to Create the Contexts for Migration Projects for more information.</description>
