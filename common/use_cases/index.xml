      <description>Activate and Deactivate Data Sources When a data source is registered in System Administration, it is automatically registered in Common to be traced.
A Data Source can be deactivated, which is helpful to reduce resource (memory, disk space, processing, etc.) consumption.
To deactivate a data source from being traced:
 Click Analyze in Navigation pane.
 Click Trace for Data Source ID.
 Click Deactivate on Page toolbar; the data source is no longer traced.</description>

      <description>Activate and Deactivate Tables When an Administrator registers a data source in System Administration, it is automatically registered in Common to be profiled. At this point, a snapshot of the database is taken and profiling begins.
Tables that are to be excluded from the profile process must be manually deactivated.
To deactivate/activate tables for profiling:
 Click Common &amp;gt; Analyze in the Navigation pane.
NOTE: The Analyze page displays Data Sources registered in System Administration that are not added to the Ignore Data Sources page and to which the logged in user has security to view.</description>

      <description>Create a User Account in Common New users often need to be added to the system. An Administrator creates user accounts as the first step in the security setup process. Using Excel Integration on the User Management page, an Administrator can add and update user account data for multiple accounts at one time. If using Excel Integration, the steps in this topic do not apply. However, the Administrator will still need to send the new users a temporary password once the spreadsheet has been imported.</description>

      <description>Update Retention Expiration Warning Period If an object is assigned a data classification that requires a retention period warning, the DSP sends a workflow email warning the Data Controller assigned to that object that data is to be purged from a target, target source, or table.
The email lists all objects to be purged, and contains a link to the object in the Collect. By default, the email is sent daily for the 7 days prior to the retention expiration date.</description>
